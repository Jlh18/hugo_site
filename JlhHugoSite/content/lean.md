Ax-Grothendieck in Lean
=======================

My masters project was formalizing the model theoretic proof of  
[Ax-Grothendieck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ax%E2%80%93Grothendieck_theorem)
in `lean`.
My repository for the `lean` code can be found 
[here](https://github.com/Jlh18/ModelTheoryInLean8)
and my paper and presentation on the subject can both be found 
[here](https://github.com/Jlh18/ModelTheory8Report).
