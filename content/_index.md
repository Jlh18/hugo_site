I work on semantics of dependent type theories.

I am a
[PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/phd/joseph-hua.html),
supervised by [Steve Awodey](https://awodey.github.io/).
My thesis will be written on the semantics of
groupoid and cubical quotients in models of HoTT.

I am a Lean enjoyer. I am working on
[HoTTLean](https://github.com/sinhp/groupoid_model_in_lean4),
where we formalize the semantics of HoTT0 in Lean,
and build an interpretation of a HoTT0 proof assistant within Lean
into those semantics.
