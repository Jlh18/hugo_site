# About me

![Me!](josephhua1.jpg)

I work on proof assistants and semantics of dependent type theories.

Currently, I am a
[PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/phd/joseph-hua.html),
supervised by [Steve Awodey](https://awodey.github.io/).
My thesis will be written on the semantics of
groupoid and cubical quotients in models of HoTT.

# Teaching resources

- **Logic and Proof**

  I updated the textbook Logic and Proof by Jeremy Avigad, Robert Lewis, and Floris van Doorn to Lean4,
  for teaching the course Logic and Mathematical Inquiry at CMU  (summer of 2024).
  Available at [leanprover-community.github.io/logic_and_proof](https://leanprover-community.github.io/logic_and_proof).

- **The HoTT Game**

  I designed a guided introduction to synthetic homotopy theory in Cubical Agda.
  Available at [thehottgameguide.readthedocs.io.](https://thehottgameguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  Demonstrate how basic higher inductive types can be constructed
  in the category of cubical sets.

<!-- I am a Lean enjoyer. I am working on
[HoTTLean](https://github.com/sinhp/groupoid_model_in_lean4),
where we formalize the semantics of HoTT0 in Lean,
and build an interpretation of a HoTT0 proof assistant within Lean
into those semantics. -->
