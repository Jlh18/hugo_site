My masters project was formalizing the model theoretic proof of
[**Ax-Grothendieck**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ax%E2%80%93Grothendieck_theorem)
in Lean.
My repository for the Lean code can be found
[here](https://github.com/Jlh18/ModelTheoryInLean8)
and my paper and presentation on the subject can both be found
[here](https://github.com/Jlh18/ModelTheory8Report).
